at the login passport authentication.. 
rn its only been set up for company logins..
i am only sending an error if email/password is wrong..
but what about userType??

so use innerjoin in sql to get all the users (cmpny, man, da, out)
and check if email and password match.. if both of them are correct then proceed to check if the uesrType == db stored uesrType
and if thats not correct then send a message incorrect usertype

i think this is less secure so maybe i should not resort to this..
lets see.. i am thinking of displaying invalid credentials 
its more secure;

at the login passport authentication.. 
rn its only been set up for company logins..
i am only sending an error if email/password is wrong..
but what about userType??

so use innerjoin in sql to get all the users (cmpny, man, da, out)
and check if email and password match.. if both of them are correct then proceed to check if the uesrType == db stored uesrType
and if thats not correct then send a message incorrect usertype

i think this is less secure so maybe i should not resort to this..
lets see.. i am thinking of displaying invalid credentials 
its more secure;


CREATE TABLE chat.users (
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	user_id TEXT,
	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES common_ids(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE chat.conversations(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	sender_id TEXT,
	receiver_id TEXT,
	FOREIGN KEY (sender_id) REFERENCES chat.users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	FOREIGN KEY (receiver_id) REFERENCES chat.users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)

CREATE TABLE chat.messages(
	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	conversation_id INT,
	sender_id TEXT REFERENCES chat.users(user_id),
	receiver_id TEXT REFERENCES chat.users(user_id),
	text TEXT,
	timestamp TIMESTAMP
)
